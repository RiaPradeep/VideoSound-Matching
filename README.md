# Audio Classification

The aim of the project is to see if the given audio and video sample belong to the same category. We've also presented three models for this problem, each of which first creates an encoding for the audio and video input independently, using various techniques, then maps them to the same space. Our results show that these models perform well with various loss functions. We also presented a novel loss function for this problem, Multi-Similarity, which builds on Cosine-BCE with increased components in the regularized term.
